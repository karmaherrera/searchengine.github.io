		<span style="text-decoration: underline;">PageRank</span><br><br>
		PageRank is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results. PageRank was named after <a href="#" class="imagehover"><img src="larry_page.jpg"/>Larry Page</a> one of the founders of Google. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages. According to Google:
		PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. 
		<br><br>The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites. 
		It is not the only algorithm used by Google to order search engine results, but it is the first algorithm that was used by the company, and it is the best-known.<br><br><br>

		<b>2) Anchor text</b><br><br>
		Anchor text is treated in a special way in search engine. Most search engine associate the text of a link with the page that the link is on. This has several advantages. First, anchors often provide more accurate descriptions of web pages than the pages themselves. Second, anchors may exist for documents which cannot be indexed by a text-based search engine, such as images, programs and database. This makes it possible to return web pages which have not actually been crawled. The idea of propagating anchor text to the page it refer to was implemented in the World Wide Web Worm especially because it helps search non-text information. Anchor text propagation is mostly used because it can help to provide better quality results.
