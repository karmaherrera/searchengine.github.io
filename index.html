	<blockquote>

		Google is one of the web search engine designed to produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. In designing Google the rate of growth web and technologies changes are taken into consideration. Google is designed to scale well to extremely large sets of data. Its data structures are optimized for fast and efficient access.<br><br>
		The design goals of google are <br><br>
		1)	Improve search quality<br>
		2)	Academic search engine research<br><br>
		
		<b>Improve Search quality</b><br><br>
		Main goal of the system is to improve the quality of the web search engines. According to Best of the Web 1994 it states that the best navigation service should make it easy to find almost anything on the web. Google make use of both <a href ="SystemFeatures.html">link structure</a> and <a href="anchortext.html"> anchor text</a> that helps in improving search and other application.<br><br>

		<b>Academic search engine research</b><br><br>
		Since web has become increasingly commercial overtime in 1993, 1.5% of web servers were on .com domains and grew to over 60% in 1997. Most search engines have gone on at companies. With google they have strong goal to push more development and understanding into the academic realm.
		One of the main goal of designing Google was to set up an environment where the other researchers can come in quickly, process large chunks of web and produce interesting results that would have been very difficult to produce otherwise.
